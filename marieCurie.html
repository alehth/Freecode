                Curie was born Marya Skłodowska in 1867 in Warsaw. Her family struggled under a repressive Tsarist
                regime, which was trying to stamp out vestiges of Polish culture.

                As a teenager, Curie made a pact with her sister Bronya: she would support Bronya while she was in
                medical school in Paris, and then Bronya would pay Curie’s way. From the age of 17, for six years, Curie
                worked as a governess and tutor, while attempting to study in her spare time.

                Finally, at age 24, she enrolled at the Sorbonne University. She could not attend the University of
                Warsaw, as her brother had: the Russian government prohibited women from attending university anywhere
                in its empire. In Paris, she felt unprepared but exhilarated.

                Curie decided to do her thesis on radiation, recently discovered in uranium by Henri Becquerel. She
                found that an ore containing uranium was far more radioactive than could be explained by its uranium
                content. This led her and her husband, Pierre, to the discovery of a new element that was 400 times more
                radioactive than uranium. In 1898 it was added to the Periodic Table as polonium, named after Curie’s
                birth country.

                For her research in “radiation phenomena,” Curie became, in 1903, the first woman to receive a Nobel
                Prize. French academics originally proposed only her husband and Henri Becquerel, but Pierre Curie
                insisted that his wife share the honour.

                Pierre Curie was the love of Curie’s life and her partner in science. They met in 1894 when Marie Curie
                worked in Pierre Curie’s lab; they were married the following year. The Curies’ affair of the heart and
                mind ended tragically not long after Eve was born. In 1906, Pierre Curie was run over by a horse and
                carriage and killed.

                During World War I, Curie promoted the use of X-rays; she developed radiological cars - which later
                became known as “petites Curies” - to allow battlefield surgeons to X-ray wounded soldiers and operate
                more accurately.

                Both Curies were constantly ill from radiation sickness, and Marie Curie’s death from aplastic anemia in
                1934, at age 66, was likely caused by radiation exposure. A few of her books and papers are still so
                radioactive that they are stored in lead boxes. It seems fitting that Curie left a scientific legacy
                that is literally untouchable.
